Overkill/Inefficiency: Using a heavy tool when a lightweight alternative suffices.\n   Example: Using 'cat' to read entire 50MB file when 'grep' or 'head' would find the needed info.\n2. Wrong Tool for Job: Tool fundamentally ill-suited for the sub-goal.\n   Example: Using 'ls' to find deeply nested file instead of 'find', or 'cat' to search instead of 'grep'.\n3. Fragile Usage: Using a tool in error-prone ways.\n   Example: Complex sed regex on entire file without verification, or rm -rf with variables.\n4. Redundant Tool: Using a tool that provides no new information given recent context.\n   Example: Running 'ls' on a directory just listed in the previous step.\n\nScoring Guide:\n- 1.0: Optimal - best tool for the job given context\n- 0.7-0.9: Good - reasonable choice, minor inefficiency\n- 0.4-0.6: Suboptimal - works but clearly better alternatives exist\n- 0.1-0.3: Poor - wrong tool or very inefficient\n- 0.0: Hallucinated - tool doesn't exist or completely nonsensical\n\nOutput must be valid JSON:\n{\n  \"action_number\": 31,\n  \"action_evaluated\": \"<First 100 chars of the action/command that was evaluated>\",\n  \"score\": <float 0.0-1.0>,\n  \"selection_quality\": \"<'Optimal', 'Good', 'Suboptimal', 'Poor', or 'Hallucinated'>\",\n  \"better_alternative\": \"<Specific better tool/command if suboptimal, or 'None' if optimal>\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"<Why this selection was good or bad for the given context>\"\n}",
