However, the command failed with a traceback during linting, indicating that the replacement either introduced a syntax issue or the tool was used without first confirming the line content. A more robust approach would be to first inspect the file (e.g., with `grep`/`cat`) and then apply the change via a diff using `Editor.apply_patch` or `Editor.edit_file`, which would give the agent better control over the edit and avoid the linting error. Hence the tool choice was appropriate in intent but suboptimal in execution.",
