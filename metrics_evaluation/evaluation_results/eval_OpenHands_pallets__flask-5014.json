It installed several unrelated dependencies (werkzeug, click, jinja2, itsdangerous, pytest) before the core issue could be reproduced, which added unnecessary steps. The reproduction script was created and run multiple times, but the agent kept reinstalling packages and re\u2011running it instead of focusing on the fix. When editing the source, the agent used a series of low\u2011level replace commands and then struggled to generate a proper diff, ending up with a submodule diff rather than the intended change. Numerous redundant git commands and failed attempts to view diffs further wasted effort. Overall, the path taken was far longer and more convoluted than needed, resulting in a low efficiency score.",
