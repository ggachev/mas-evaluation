You are not allowed to change the tests in the project. To make it clear for you, search the project and make a plan how to tackle the problem before you start. The problem is defined in the text document problem_statement.txt. The folder path is in the problem_statement.txt. Please do not ask any questions. The diff should be only about the changes you made in the project, so do not use the git diff function but create it yourself.

The problem is defined in the text document problem_statement.txt. The folder path is in the problem_statement.txt. Please do not ask any questions.
