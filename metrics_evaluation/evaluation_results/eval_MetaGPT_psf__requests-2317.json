However, the subsequent actions diverged from this plan: there is no evidence that the problem_statement.txt was read, the repository was searched, or a concrete fix plan was documented. The agent performed a series of file edits (some of which failed with an IndexError) and then read diff.txt without having reliably produced the required diff. The final reply to the human does not include the promised diff.txt and the task is marked finished despite the earlier error. The deviation was not a justified adaptation to new information but rather a loss of track of the original plan, resulting in low adherence.",
