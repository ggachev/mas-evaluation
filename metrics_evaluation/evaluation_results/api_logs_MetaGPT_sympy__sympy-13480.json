Analyze each message in the communication log.\n2. Classify each message as predominantly SIGNAL or NOISE.\n3. Identify specific communication bottlenecks, loops, or inefficiencies.\n4. Calculate the overall signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nScoring Guide:\n- 1.0: Perfectly efficient - all messages contribute directly to task completion\n- 0.8-0.9: Highly efficient - minimal noise, clear and focused communication\n- 0.6-0.7: Moderately efficient - some redundancy but generally productive\n- 0.4-0.5: Inefficient - significant noise, unclear handoffs, or redundant exchanges\n- 0.2-0.3: Poor - major bottlenecks, loops, or miscommunication\n- 0.0-0.1: Dysfunctional - communication actively hinders progress\n\nOutput must be valid JSON:\n{\n  \"score\": <float between 0.0 and 1.0>,\n  \"signal_percentage\": <int 0-100, estimated percentage of messages that are SIGNAL>,\n  \"noise_percentage\": <int 0-100, estimated percentage of messages that are NOISE>,\n  \"total_messages_analyzed\": <int>,\n  \"bottlenecks\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"<'Loop', 'Misunderstanding', 'Vague Handoff', 'Redundant Exchange', 'Missing Acknowledgment'>\",\n      \"description\": \"<Concise description of the issue>\",\n      \"agents_involved\": [\"<agent1>\", \"<agent2>\"],\n      \"impact\": \"<'Minor', 'Moderate', 'Severe'>\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"communication_patterns\": {\n    \"handoff_clarity\": \"<'Clear', 'Mostly Clear', 'Often Vague', 'Unclear'>\",\n    \"information_flow\": \"<'Unidirectional', 'Bidirectional Balanced', 'Hub-and-Spoke', 'Chaotic'>\",\n    \"response_relevance\": \"<'High', 'Medium', 'Low'>\"\n  },\n  \"reasoning\": \"<Brief analysis of overall communication efficiency, highlighting key strengths and weaknesses>\",\n  \"method\": \"llm_as_a_judge\"\n}",
