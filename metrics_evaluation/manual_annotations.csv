scikit-learn__scikit-learn-12585,MetaGPT,0,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,"134 steps, $8 cost for simple one-line fix. Constant edit tool failures due to linting issues. Agent asked human for help (Step 64, 75, 79, 85) despite autonomous requirement. Rewrote entire base.py instead of minimal fix. Path handling issues with spaces. Multi-agent overhead with little benefit."
scikit-learn__scikit-learn-12585,live-swe-agent,1,4,5,5,5,4,3,5,,"Clean execution with clear plan. Minor bash syntax errors (heredoc chaining, regex escaping). Recovered quickly from failed patch attempts. Excellent reasoning and verification workflow. Minimal fix identical to expected solution."
pallets__flask-5014,OpenHands,0,2,3,3,5,3,3,4,,"Correct fix implemented (empty name check). Inefficient dependency management (4 individual pip installs instead of requirements.txt). Major struggle with diff generation (~35 steps with git embedded repo issues and multiple Python syntax errors in heredocs). Final diff in non-standard patch format."
pallets__flask-5014,SWE-agent,1,4,4,5,5,4,4,5,,"Efficient execution in 33 steps ($0.03). Direct navigation to Blueprint class. Clean fix with good edge case handling (added check in both __init__ and register() method). One initial view_range error and some grep syntax errors. Verified fix with inline Python test."
pallets__flask-5014,MetaGPT,0,2,3,2,4,2,2,3,3,"41 steps, $1.96 cost (66x more than SWE-agent). Two edit failures due to linting.

Multi-agent overhead with minimal benefit."
pallets__flask-5014,live-swe-agent,1,1,2,3,5,3,2,2,,"181 steps, $0.30 cost for simple fix. Excellent initial implementation with isinstance() and strip() check for whitespace. Major distraction: spent ~140 steps trying to fix pre-existing cookie domain test failures unrelated to Blueprint task. Multiple format errors and bash syntax issues (applypatch not found, && chaining). Eventually succeeded after reverting unrelated changes."
psf__requests-2317,OpenHands,0,2,2,3,5,3,3,3,,"160 steps, $0.18 cost. Correctly identified fix (to_native_string instead of builtin_str). However, spent ~100 steps fixing unrelated Python 3.10+ collections.abc compatibility issues in 6 files. applypatch command failed 8+ times. Included .DS_Store in diff. Original one-line fix buried in extensive compatibility changes."

psf__requests-2317,live-swe-agent,0,4,4,4,5,4,3,4,,"55 steps, $0.04 cost. Excellent: recognized need to fix BOTH sessions.py and models.py. Used to_native_string in both files. Good multi-step verification. However, likely missing import of to_native_string in models.py causing NameError. One bash syntax error (&&). PreparedRequest.prepare() test crashed on unrelated hooks issue."
