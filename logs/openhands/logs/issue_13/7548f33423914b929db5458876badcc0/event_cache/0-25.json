Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

E.g. you could push changes with one step by running the following bash commands:\n```bash\ngit remote -v && git branch # to find the current org, repo and branch\ngit checkout -b create-widget && git add . && git commit -m \"Create widget\" && git push -u origin create-widget\n```"}]}}, {"id": 8, "timestamp": "2025-12-13T15:43:53.744665", "source": "agent", "message": "Reading file: /workspace/problem_statement.txt", "action": "read", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "str_replace_editor", "tool_call_id": "call_yuhGBv8CwPuSd0kustR908ji", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-CmM4e34hdCXQGrFSm6gvt2xG8JbJM", "created": 1765640632, "model": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"command\":\"view\",\"path\":\"/workspace/problem_statement.txt\",\"view_range\":[1,200],\"security_risk\":\"LOW\"}", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, "id": "call_yuhGBv8CwPuSd0kustR908ji", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 45, "prompt_tokens": 9377, "total_tokens": 9422, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 7808, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "llm_metrics": {"accumulated_cost": 0.00067745, "max_budget_per_task": null, "accumulated_token_usage": {"model": "default", "prompt_tokens": 9377, "completion_tokens": 45, "cache_read_tokens": 7808, "cache_write_tokens": 0, "context_window": 272000, "per_turn_token": 0, "response_id": ""}, "costs": [], "response_latencies": [], "token_usages": []}, "args": {"path": "/workspace/problem_statement.txt", "start": 0, "end": -1, "thought": "", "security_risk": 0, "impl_source": "oh_aci", "view_range": [1, 200]}}, {"id": 9, "timestamp": "2025-12-13T15:43:53.786632", "source": "agent", "message": "I read the file /workspace/problem_statement.txt.", "cause": 8, "observation": "read", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "str_replace_editor", "tool_call_id": "call_yuhGBv8CwPuSd0kustR908ji", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-CmM4e34hdCXQGrFSm6gvt2xG8JbJM", "created": 1765640632, "model": "gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "tool_calls", "index": 0, "message": {"content": null, "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"command\":\"view\",\"path\":\"/workspace/problem_statement.txt\",\"view_range\":[1,200],\"security_risk\":\"LOW\"}", "name": "str_replace_editor"}, "id": "call_yuhGBv8CwPuSd0kustR908ji", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 45, "prompt_tokens": 9377, "total_tokens": 9422, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 7808, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}, "total_calls_in_response": 1}, "content": "NOTE: We only show up to 72 since there're only 72 lines in this file.\nHere's the result of running `cat -n` on /workspace/problem_statement.txt:\n     1\tFolder Path /matplotlib\n     2\t\n     3\t[Bug]: get_backend() clears figures from Gcf.figs if they were created under rc_context\n     4\t### Bug summary\n     5\t\n     6\tcalling `matplotlib.get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf` if the *first* figure in `Gcf.figs` was created in an `rc_context`.\n     7\t\n     8\t### Code for reproduction\n     9\t\n    10\t```python\n    11\timport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    12\tfrom matplotlib import get_backend, rc_context\n    13\t\n    14\t# fig1 = plt.figure() #
