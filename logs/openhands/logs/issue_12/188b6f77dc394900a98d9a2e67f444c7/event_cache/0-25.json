Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

Then each common divisor of  a  and  b\n    divides  r, and it follows that  gcd(a, b) == gcd(b, r).\n    The algorithm works by constructing the sequence\n    r0, r1, r2, ..., where  r0 = a, r1 = b,  and each  rn\n    is the remainder from the division of the two preceding\n    elements.\n\n    In Python, q = a // b  and  r = a % b  are obtained by the\n    floor division and the remainder operations, respectively.\n    These are the most expensive arithmetic operations, especially\n    for large  a  and  b.\n\n    Lehmer's algorithm is based on the observation that the quotients\n    qn = r(n-1) // rn  are in general small integers even\n    when  a  and  b  are very large. Hence the quotients can be\n    usually determined from a relatively small number of most\n    significant bits.\n\n    The efficiency of the algorithm is further enhanced by not\n    computing each long remainder in Euclid's sequence. The remainders\n    are linear combinations of  a  and  b  with integer coefficients\n    derived from the quotients. The coefficients can be computed\n    as far as the quotients can be determined from the chosen\n    most significant parts of  a  and  b. Only then a new pair of\n    consecutive remainders is computed and the algorithm starts\n    anew with this pair.\n\n    References\n    ==========\n\n    ..

are not atomic.\n\n    See Also\n    ========\n\n    Float, Integer, Rational\n    \"\"\"\n    is_commutative = True\n    is_number = True\n    is_Number = True\n\n    __slots__ = ()\n\n    # Used to

  >>> Float(100, 4)\n    100.0\n\n    Float can automatically count significant figures if a null string\n    is sent for the precision; spaces or underscores are also allowed. (Auto-\n    counting is only allowed for strings, ints and longs).\n\n    >>> Float('123 456 789.123_456', '')\n    123456789.123456\n    >>> Float('12e-3', '')\n    0.012\n    >>> Float(3, '')\n    3.\n\n    If a number is written in scientific notation, only the digits before the\n    exponent are considered significant if a decimal appears, otherwise the\n    \"e\" signifies only how to move the decimal:\n\n    >>> Float('60.e2', '')  # 2 digits significant\n    6.0e+3\n    >>> Float('60e2', '')  # 4 digits significant\n    6000.\n    >>> Float('600e-2', '')  # 3 digits significant\n    6.00\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    Floats are inexact by their nature unless their value is a binary-exact\n    value.\n\n    >>> approx, exact = Float(.1, 1), Float(.125, 1)\n\n    For calculation purposes, evalf needs to be able to change the precision\n    but this will not increase the accuracy of the inexact value. The\n    following is the most accurate 5-digit approximation of a value of 0.1\n    that had only 1 digit of precision:\n\n    >>> approx.evalf(5)\n    0.099609\n\n    By contrast, 0.125 is exact in binary (as it is in base 10) and so it\n    can be passed to Float or evalf to obtain an arbitrary precision with\n    matching accuracy:\n\n    >>> Float(exact, 5)\n    0.12500\n    >>> exact.evalf(20)\n    0.12500000000000000000\n\n    Trying to make a high-precision Float from a float is not disallowed,\n    but one must keep in mind that the *underlying float* (not the apparent\n    decimal value) is being obtained with high precision. For example, 0.3\n    does not have a finite binary representation. The closest rational is\n    the fraction 5404319552844595/2**54. So if you try to obtain a Float of\n    0.3 to 20 digits of precision you will not see the same thing as 0.3\n    followed by 19 zeros:\n\n    >>> Float(0.3, 20)\n    0.29999999999999998890\n\n    If you want a 20-digit value of the decimal 0.3 (not the floating point\n    approximation of 0.3) you should send the 0.3 as a string. The underlying\n    representation is still binary but a higher precision than Python's float\n    is used:\n\n    >>> Float('0.3', 20)\n    0.30000000000000000000\n\n    Although you can increase the precision of an existing Float using Float\n    it will not increase the accuracy -- the underlying value is not changed:\n\n    >>> def show(f): # binary rep of Float\n    ...     from sympy import Mul, Pow\n    ...     s, m, e, b = f._mpf_\n    ...     v = Mul(int(m), Pow(2, int(e), evaluate=False), evaluate=False)\n    ...     print('%s at prec=%s' % (v, f._prec))\n    ...\n    >>> t = Float('0.3', 3)\n    >>> show(t)\n    4915/2**14 at prec=13\n    >>> show(Float(t, 20)) # higher prec, not higher accuracy\n    4915/2**14 at prec=70\n    >>> show(Float(t, 2)) # lower prec\n    307/2**10 at prec=10\n\n    The same thing happens when evalf is used on a Float:\n\n    >>> show(t.evalf(20))\n    4915/2**14 at prec=70\n    >>> show(t.evalf(2))\n    307/2**10 at prec=10\n\n    Finally, Floats can be instantiated with an mpf tuple (n, c, p) to\n    produce the number (-1)**n*c*2**p:\n\n    >>> n, c, p = 1, 5, 0\n    >>> (-1)**n*c*2**p\n    -5\n    >>> Float((1, 5, 0))\n    -5.00000000000000\n\n    An actual mpf tuple also contains the number of bits in c as the last\n    element of the tuple:\n\n    >>> _._mpf_\n    (1, 5, 0, 3)\n\n    This is not needed for instantiation and is not the same thing as the\n    precision. The mpf tuple and the precision are two separate quantities\n    that Float tracks.\n\n    In SymPy, a Float is a number that can be computed with arbitrary\n    precision.

other types of strings can be handled by\n    the sympify() function, and conversion of floats to expressions\n    or simple fractions can be handled with nsimplify:\n\n    >>> S('.[3]')  # repeating
